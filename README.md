# WebsiteSpeechRecognition

This is a restaurant review website that can be navigated using voice command

Node_modules folder contains to many files, thus it is not uploaded. Thus cannot do login to submit reviews or edit reviews

However, you still can navigate to list the restaurant, view the restaurant details and reviews.

Look a the readme.txt in the SR_ZiaBaBa folder

The login, sign-up and contact us function does not have speech recognition capabilities build in yet (only can mouse click).
